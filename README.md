This is the first project completed in the Coding Temple Bootcamp Modules.  
The project, although fairly simple in concept, is being completed within the first two weeks of the program. I'm sure there are better ways of achieving the goals of this program. If you have any feedback, I welcome you to email me or submit changes directly through github (Thank you for taking the time to visit. If you have any questions, please contact me at the email above. 

### To run the program
Download todolist.py from this GitHub repository to your local machine, and run in your existing Python terminal using VScode or a similar IDE. Once the program runs, it's pretty simple and intuitive. Just follow the prompts to build your list. You'll find more details below:

### Adding a Task
1. The program is designed to take a single input each time you select add a task.
2. You are able to add any combinations of letters and numbers that you wish as the task name. The input will return a string of the characters entered.
3. Once you add a task, you'll get a confirmation message, the new item will be added to the end of the list, and a traditional ordered list will display above the program menu. 

### Deleting a Task
The functionality to delete tasks was the most challenging part of the assignment

### Error Handling


### What I would change
I'd like to have the names of the task print through the for loop with title case


### Why My Project Stands Out
