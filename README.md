This is the first project completed in the Coding Temple Boot-camp Modules.  
The project, although fairly simple in concept, is being completed within the first two weeks of the program. I'm sure there are better ways of achieving the goals of this program. If you have any feedback, I welcome you to email me or submit changes directly through [GitHub](https://github.com/Vogon-P0et/module-1-project). If you have any questions, please contact me at the email above. Thank you for taking the time to visit.

### To Run The Program
Download the .py file from this GitHub repository to your local machine, and run in your existing Python terminal using VScode or a similar IDE. Once the program runs, it's pretty simple and intuitive. Just follow the prompts to build your list. You'll find more details below:

### Adding a Task
1. The program is designed to take a single input each time you select add a task.
2. You are able to add any combinations of letters and numbers that you wish as the task name. The input will return a string of the characters entered.
3. Once you add a task, you'll get a confirmation message, the new item will be added to the end of the list, and a traditional ordered list will display above the program menu. 

### Deleting a Task
The functionality to delete tasks was the most challenging part of the assignment to develop. 

### Error Handling
The only error handling in the assignment that used try, except, else, and finally was in the delete selection in the program. The remaining attempts at error handling were through conditional statements that caught the possible exceptions under the else statement and print error statements. The while loop ensures the program keeps running until the user desires to quit. 

### What I Would Change
I'd like to have the names of the task print through the for loop with title case. I was also unable to adapt any functions into the program. I tried to make sure each requirement was satisfied and this was the only one I couldn't add in with my current understanding. Not that I don't understand functions, but I was unsure how the use of functions would improve the code. 


### Why My Project Stands Out
This project is extremely simple and intuitive. The menu is kept short, the user can exit at any time, and functionality is smooth, offering a clean terminal output.
